Integrate the Basler a2A5320-23ucBAS camera into the UAS for object detection, classification, and localization tasks. The camera must be capable of capturing high-quality images for identifying standard and emergent objects within the Air Drop Boundary.

## Requirements

- **Resolution:** Minimum of 3840 x 2160 pixels to capture detailed images for accurate object identification.
- **Frame Rate:** At least 20 fps to ensure smooth video capture for dynamic analysis.
- **Color Depth:** Minimum of 12 bits per channel to accurately render colors for object classification. (Being Investigated, might change)
- **Dynamic Range:** High dynamic range (>60 dB) to handle varying lighting conditions during flight.
- **Interface:** USB 3.0 or higher for fast data transfer and real-time image processing. (USB works for now)
- **Power Consumption:** Optimized for minimal power draw to not significantly impact UAS battery life.
- **Weight and Dimensions:** Should be lightweight and compact to fit within the payload constraints of the UAS.
- **Environmental Adaptability:** Capable of operating in varying outdoor conditions, including temperature changes and vibrations.
    - Prepare multiple configuration files for most weather conditions
- **Software Compatibility:** Must be compatible with image processing software used for object detection and classification tasks.
